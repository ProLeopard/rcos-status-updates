## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I looked over the OpenCircuits code and tried my best to understand what was going on. I followed the flow of the classes and things began making sense. As I will not be working on the current version of OpenCircuits and will be developing a lower level electrical engineering version, I was thinking of ideas and told my project lead that I could help him by designing theoretical unit tests for components that would be implemented in the future. He liked the idea so I got to work on that.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I need to finish all the theoretical unit tests before the next class. I need to make sure that each test will properly test all of the functionality of each component. The goal is to finish all of them but some may be significantly harder than others so I will do as many as I can. I also need to become further familiarized with GitHub and TypeScript. On top of this, I should also look over the GitHub slides because I'm not comfortable with it yet.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Skiing on Sunday, lack of extensive programming knowledge, Econ Test, and long/difficult Econ homework are all obstacles setting me back from adequately completing my task. However, these should not prevent me from doing what I have to.

## Notes

> I apologize for the lateness. Totally forgot about it yesterday and asked my friend how to do this thing today. I was offered help from my mentor but I told myself I'd do it later and ended up forgetting yesterday.
