## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Our project lead created our new repository for OpenCircuits EE so we were finally able to begin writing code. I started working on our unit tests, which will no longer be theoretical as they are being implemented. We (Myself and Jon) worked out the math for these tests and thought about how we would design the functions. We then began coding the unit tests and making sure they would test for the right things and provide accurate results. The tests that are being implemented currently calculate Current, Power, Voltage, and Resistance for each component in a DC Series Circuit.

## This Week's Plan

> I want to finish writing all the basic series circuit tests for OpenCircuits EE and be ready to start creating the functions that will actually find the right values for the resistance, power, voltage, and current. Ideally, we will be able to complete the tests next week and check them to make sure they are behaving properly and then next week we can start coding the functions and testing them. Since we have not implemented parallel circuits, we will only calculate these 4 values (current, power, voltage, resistance) at each component, and not in the wires between components. When we have parallel circuits, we will calculate them at the nodes, which is something we had to think about before designing our tests and something to keep in mind for our function creation.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing, save for my initial knowledge about how to create unit tests. I am learning, however, and they are not too complicated so I am confident I can stay ahead.
