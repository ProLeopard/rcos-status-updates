## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on the presentation, adding details about my contribution to the project. Because I am working on a relatively different part of the project (OpenCircuits EE), I have not been able to create many commits. Most of what we have done so far is planning, but this week I was finally able to implement some code and create some functions. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will finish working on the presentation and hopefully contribute some more functions and logic. We are waiting on another team member to implement a node system and graphs, which will be vital in creating parallel circuits. We cannot create parallel circuits without these, but we will begin creating the functions/mathematics for these circuits, starting with the unit tests.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing.
