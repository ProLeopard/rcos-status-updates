## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was unfortunately unable to do too much work due to a few midterms this week. I am awaiting the completion of the other half of OpenCircuits so our project lead can focus his attention more on the part of the project that I'll be working on.

## This Week's Plan

> I'm gonna chill for a little bit and enjoy the break. I think I will plan out the things I will do for next week, including some of the more difficult theoretical unit tests.

## Anything Blocking?

> It's break!
