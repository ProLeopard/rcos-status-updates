## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote theoretical unit tests for a few of the electrical components. I was able to create an algorithm to appropriately test voltmeters, ammeters, resistors, transistors, and other components.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to continue writing these unit tests for all of the other electrical components. This may take some time for some of the more complicated components but I will try my best to finish a few more before the next small group meeting.

## Anything Blocking?

> Economics homework, IED project planning and presentation, and spending time with my parents this weekend will all cut into my time.

## Notes

> None
