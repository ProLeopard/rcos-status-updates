## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I learned a little bit more TypeScript and wrote a function to calculate power. This is a great accomplishment for me as I have not coded in a long time and I hated programming after a bad experience with AP CS. I had decided to give it a second try in RCOS and I am glad I did because I was able to actually do something that worked and made sense. The function initially passed half of the tests and not the other half so I rewrote it and in about an hour was able to get all of the tests to pass. I helped Jon write the code for resistance, current, and voltage but I did not do those myself entirely. I watched Jon write the first few functions before I helped so I knew what to do.

## This Week's Plan

> I want to start working on the presentation and add information about my contributions. Due to the fact that I have worked primarily on OpenCircuits EE I will not have my own slide on the presentation but I will explain what I did in the first OpenCircuits EE slide. I will also describe what it is and all the things we have done so far as a group. I may highlight some of my personal contributions but I was learning for a good portion of RCOS but I did work as hard as I could to contribute whatever I could.

## Anything Blocking?
