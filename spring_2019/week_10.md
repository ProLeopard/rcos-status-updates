## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was able to create a few more functions and we tested more unit tests. 3/9 failed at first but we figured out the issues, changed the logic, and everything ended up working fine. I finished working on the presentation as I said I would in the previous status update, and added information about my contributions and what will occur in OpenCircuits EE in the near future.

## This Week's Plan

> This is the last week and therefore there is not much of a plan. However, I do plan to contribute over the summer as I enjoy the project and its purpose. As I will be taking some CS classes over the summer, my knowledge of CS will be far better as time goes on and I will be able to contribute exponentially more.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing at the moment, save for my lack of extensive knowledge of TypeScript.
