## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was able to complete all of the unit tests that I wanted to last week. We (myself and Jon) made sure the tests are behaving properly and made sure to recalculate all of our values multiple times to confirm that they were correct. Peer review was also used to guarantee no mistakes were made. We defined default values for voltage, current, and resistance, which are 5V, 5mA, and 1k Ohms, respectively. These will be useful when we are looking to calculate these values at the components. It was determined that these are the proper standard values and they will be the defaults for the components that you put in the circuits. For example, when you add a resistor into the circuit, it will default to 1k Ohms.

## This Week's Plan
 
> Now, we will create the actual functions. When we have these done, we will be able to check their functionality with the unit tests we have already created and determined are correct. If the tests fail, then our function is incorrect in some way and if not then we have implemented the function correctly. We have already worked on the logic so our only next steps are to create the functions that calculate the voltage, power, current, and resistance at each component. The only components currently are resistors and voltage sources, so we will be able to create series circuits and determine whether the right numbers are being calculated in those basic components. If they are correct, we can start creating more components. As a whole, I will basically work with my partner to write the classes and functions that will display the appropriate voltage, current, resistance, and power values for each component when it is clicked in the circuit.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing right now.
