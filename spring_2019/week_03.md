## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote theoretical unit tests for a few more of the electrical components. I realized that I will actually have to do twice the work I thought I had to because I have to write theoretical tests for AC voltages as well. The changing polarity causes electrical components to behave in completely different ways so it is important that they are also implemented and each component works the way it should for both DC and AC.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to finish the theoretical unit tests and description of components for transistors and operational amplifiers at least. I will try to do inductors as well but depending on the things blocking I may not be able to.

## Anything Blocking?

> Economics midterm, economics homework, Entrepreneurship midterm, and leaving early on Friday.

## Notes

> Apologize for the lateness, was exhausted yesterday night and went right to bed before I did this thing and forgot about it the next morning.
