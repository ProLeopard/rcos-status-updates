## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was assigned to work with a partner finally (Jon Schmalz). We will be working on the lower level electrical engineering portion of OpenCircuits which will include wiring basic circuits with resistors, capacitors, and other components as well as more complex circuits as time goes on. The software will function essentially like a web based version of a Spice program like LTSpice. We hope to make this software far more easy to use than current Spice softwares. I was able to finish all of the prior theoretical unit tests on a Word Document and was also able to complete detailed descriptions on the appropriate functions of each device.

## This Week's Plan

> I will wait for my project lead (Leon) to create a new repository for myself and Jon to begin working on our initial files, ReadMe, and our first algorithms. We will attempt to set up the environment the way we like and create a foundation for which to build upon later. Fortunately, we do know the exact scope of this project and how detailed we will get, so creating enough expandability from the beginning should not be a problem. We will have to make sure to consider our future additions and build a strong foundation for our program. I will try my best to familiarize myself with TypeScript a little bit before we begin working.

## Anything Blocking?

> DiffEQ Test on Monday and my lack of programming knowledge (especially in TypeScript). I will have to do a great deal of work to understand programming a bit more for this project. I will be infinitely more knowledgeable next semester (in terms of programming at least) and hope to contribute more then.
