## Last Week's Accomplishments

> To be completely honest I did not really do too much this week. We did have to present one more time so I made sure to practice the presentation once again and make sure I knew what I was saying. I made it a little bit shorter because we would have less time this time.

## This Week's Plan

> This is finals week and therefore there is not much of a plan. However, as I said in the previous status update, I do plan to contribute over the summer as I enjoy the project and its purpose.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope!
